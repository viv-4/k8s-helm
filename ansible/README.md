# Example PlaceOS Complex Deployment

Example provisioning PlaceOS and third party helm charts in a more "production like" deployment using Ansible.

Contains 4 roles:

- `placeos.helm`: deploy the core PlaceOS charts without thirdparty services
- `placeos.helm.thirdparty`: deploy the thirdparty services
- `placeos.helm.releasevars`: retreive existing chart release vars to prevent regenerating passwords for rethinkdb
- `placeos.networkpolicies` : create k8s network polices for the deployed resources. Note: Does not work with k3d without modifying the default SDN.eg By switching to Calico SDN

## Prerequisites

- Ansible >= 2.9 on Python 3

- Openshift python library. To install `pip install openshift`

- Install the community.kubernetes Ansible collection: `ansible-galaxy collection install community.kubernetes`

- Review the requirements for the [Ansible helm wrapper](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.10/collections/community/kubernetes/helm_module.html)


Note: Tested with:

- Ansible collection `community.kubernetes:1.0.0`
- k8s versions 1.17 and 1.18
- Helm v3.3.1

## Executing

To deploy:

```sh
# Local deployment to k3d
# Check first be for deploying
ansible-playbook placeos.yaml -i inventories/k3d/ --check
ansible-playbook placeos.yaml -i inventories/k3d/
## Not Suported on local install > ansible-playbook placeos-network-policies.yaml


# GKE deployment
# Check first be for deploying
ansible-playbook placeos.yaml -i inventories/gke/  --check
ansible-playbook placeos.yaml -i inventories/gke/
ansible-playbook placeos-network-policies.yaml

# AKS deployment
# Check first be for deploying
ansible-playbook placeos.yaml -i inventories/aks/  --check
ansible-playbook placeos.yaml -i inventories/aks/
ansible-playbook placeos-network-policies.yaml

```

To cleanup:

```sh
ansible-playbook placeos.yaml -i inventories/k3d/ -e "chart_state=absent"
ansible-playbook placeos.yaml -i inventories/aks/ -e "chart_state=absent"
ansible-playbook placeos.yaml -i inventories/gke/ -e "chart_state=absent"

ansible-playbook placeos-network-policies.yaml  -e "policy_state=absent"

# Note: you will also need to clean up the PVs created by the StatefulSets manually
# Secrets and Configmaps for PlaceOS are not deleted in the clean up

```

## Limitations

The role `placeos.helm.releasevars` is a convenience method to prevent overiding the rethinkdb password.

In a real world situation the admin password would not be shared

Each charts should be managed seperately as seperate playbooks.

Make sure to delete PVCs left over by StatefulSets when when uninstalling charts
